You put down the book and decide to leave the house, you do not like all of this history.
The steps creak, almost as if to wish you farewell.
You stagger through the steam and rigid rocks.
You glance over your shoulder to see the house for probably the last time in your life.
When you see a figure.
Someone there, stood at the entrance of the house.
You blink and the figure is nowhere to be seen.
You decide to get back to the top of the mountain where the new Finch cemetery lies.
You run up the stone steps and open the gate and look back out at the old Finch family home.
The tide comes back in.
In the form of a huge wave.
You were lucky to get out when you did.
You then jump on the motorbike and zoom off in the deep forest.
Where every member of your family had been since 1937.
Well done...
