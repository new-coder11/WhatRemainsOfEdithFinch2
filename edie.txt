Edie
I am writing in this book, because I know it is what you would have wanted.
To be in the same book as your mother and brother.
No one in the family really knows what happened to you.
No even my mother.
But I do.
I am writing in here so in fifty years time, my child will find this book and read it.
Everyone knows you mysteriously left this house but I know you wanted to see your father one last time.
Once more before you died.
I never met you, but from what my father said what my mother thought of you,
I feel like we would have gotten on.
Your Great Great Grandson,
Christopher Finch
