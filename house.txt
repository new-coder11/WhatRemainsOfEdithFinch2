You look around the front room, chairs, tables, rubble everywhere. All walls soaked through. Water stain all around.
The kitchen is almost worse.
The hob smashed. It appears that there could have been a fire when it went down.
Glass cups, mugs and cutlery litter the floor while their drawers lie in small pieces.
A photograph of Odin, Ingeborg, Edie and Sven lying on the floor along with its wrecked frame.
The stairs rotting away.
Upstairs is the worst however.
Everything from all rooms litter the hallway.
You can see that Edie and Sven packed their stuff very quickly to get out.
You walk back down the stairs, gripping onto the banister, as if the stairs were going to fall away at any time.
Of which they could.
