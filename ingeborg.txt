Ingeborg..
I loved you with all of my heart
Before you died, I don't think I appreciated you as much as I needed to
After the bear attacked you and killed you, I made sure to kill it
I also used it well, I fed it to myself and Johann
I think he enjoyed it
But we will mourn you for as long as we both live
Love you..
Your Husband
